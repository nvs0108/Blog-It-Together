            <p>Thinking about a place to visit in South India to relax and make your vacation memorable? 
                Here is my travel experience to Kodaikanal. Check this out to learn more about how to make 
                your holidays in Kodaikanal more joyful. <br><br>Do you ever look at the clouds while being stuck in 
                traffic and fit them into your wild imaginations of unicorns and funnily shaped animals? 
                Now visualize this; you're in a home-stay fixated in one of the crevices of the excessively 
                green covered mountains, sipping on Vattakanal's home-brewed hot chocolate and a Columbus decides 
                to pay you a visit. In a matter of seconds, suddenly the room turns blurry, and you can literally 
                see the cloud gracefully pass in front of your eyes. This is how Kodaikanal welcomes you!</p>

                <p>Places like this rejuvenate a person. It recharges one's mental state of being which usually 
                    depreciates with one's monotonous corporate or routine lifestyle. This beautiful, memorable 
                    trip began with the desperate need for a road trip. From an idea of a solo trip on a motorcycle 
                    to over two dozen excited, adrenaline junkies packed in two cars ready to hit the roads happened
                     overnight. An unplanned rendezvous and the 470 km journey began.</p>

                <h2 style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>How to get there?</strong></h2>
                <p>Now, you could choose a less tiring and faster means of transport and book a sleeper bus to Kodaikanal;
                 but the adventure and thrill in a self-driven vehicle are unrivalled. But this alternative has its own 
                 red flags; Stress on the proclaimed driver of the group, delay due to a couple of wrong turns owing to the 
                 inexperience of the shotgun and too many stops. Eleven hours of rigorous driving, few seat shifts, 
                 multiple-genre music and voila, the fresh breath of Kodai. Goosebumps and blocked ears are inescapable 
                 with the drastic shift in altitude. Lush greenery, vividly coloured flowers, scenic canopies in a distance 
                 half-dressed in clouds, the sound of crickets summoning the kodai showers and fellow tourists is just a 
                 thumbnail for you.

                <p>Finding a place to stay wouldn't be an issue. The travel agencies and room renters can sniff tourists 
                    and the moment they see you walking with a backpack they would pounce on you like scavengers, 
                    advertising their varied accommodation options. Just pick the one that suits your needs and you 
                    should be set. The locals are friendly and definitely helpful when it comes to directions, places 
                    to visit and small requirements like firewood for a campfire maybe?!<br><br>
                    Although you've not travelled hundreds of kilometres to stay indoors a good home-stay surely 
                    makes a difference. The accommodation is reasonably cheap and thus choosing a good one is 
                    critical. Waking up to a breathtaking view of the mountains is sheer joy in itself.</p>
